# **HCL Domino 14 - Why Upgrade - Part 2**

**`#domino14`** has just been launched. We at **`#hclsoftware`** believe in the concept of continuous innovation fuelled by constant 360 degree feedback. Any new HCL Domino release follows a meticulous procedure of having Jams, Early Access Pack and a process of collecting early feedback to make the necessary course corrections if needed. We will not rest on our laurels and will start planning for next release so the process simply goes on like we say **`#dominoforever`**.

In the last article - [**Link here**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hcl-domino-14-why-upgrade-rishab-sharma-js6rc/?trackingId=xcY8q6WbTie0iSGgxZYZKQ%3D%3D) we spoke about basic guiding principles about Domino 14. In this article we dwell a little bit more deeper on these key innovations.

## **What's New - Domino 14**

- **Expanded Out-of-Box Offerings**

No longer do you need to install [**HCL Nomad**](https://www.hcl-software.com/wps/wcm/connect/1b8fdfac-6d7f-4a95-9295-afd5cd3b7692/HCL+Nomad+Brochure+17Mar2023.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE-1b8fdfac-6d7f-4a95-9295-afd5cd3b7692-oKleWDE&referrer=blog.hcltechsw.com) or [**HCL Verse**](https://www.hcl-software.com/verse?referrer=blog.hcltechsw.com) separately. Domino 14 makes it easy as the these offerings get preinstalled along with the Domino 14 Installer. We also have included [OnTime Calendar](https://ontimesuite.com/en/domino/product/share-my-time) which allows you to share your calendar across regardless of your mailing solution. All this makes deployment faster and less hassle free.

- **Auto Update**

Keeping server versions current is always important as it ensures all security patches are current and also new functionality is delivered. The issue is information about updates sometimes are not readily available and applying updates could be a challenge. Domino 14 eliminates this using a feature called Auto Update. Now you can notified of new updates, updates can be downloaded automatically and can be applied in a scheduled manner.

- **Passkey Authentication**

All cyber security experts acknowledge that one of the weakest link is password. Passwords can be cracked or hacked and are targets of various attacks like Social Engineering etc. We at HCL Software are changing the paradigm by adopting the next generation capability which redefines authentication. This allows for users to sign in through fingerprints, face scans or screen-lock PINs.

- **Admin Central**

No longer are Administrators limited to the Domino Administrator. We have added a brand new capability which will allow you to manage users and groups from any device. This facility will be expanded so that Administrators can access / manage the Domino Server from Browser from any device including Mobile.

There are even more exciting improvements that you have been waiting for, such as our self-healing DAOS repository for clustered servers, enhancing DAOS, improving Domino Backup, IDVault/OIDC, streamlined the Domino Installer options, etc.

- **Mail Merge**

This long-awaited feature is now a reality! HCL Notes introduces MailMerge.

HCL Traveler and HCL Enterprise Integrator and HCL Domino Administrator were also upgraded with the same spirit using the latest compilers, now powered by **Java 17**.
