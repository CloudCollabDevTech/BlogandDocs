# **UDP (Low-Code No-Code) - Powered by HCL Volt MX - Primer Series 4 / N**

## **Introduction to HCL Leap - No Code**

As explained in the [previous article](https://blog.cloudcollabdevtech.com/blog/2024/01/30/udp-low-code-no-code---powered-by-hcl-volt-mx---primer-series-3--n.html) - we explored the basic building blocks of HCL Leap.

In this article we will understand how to use **HCL Leap** in a more better manner and become a seasoned citizen developer. **HCL Leap** is very advanced platform which will allow you develop very sophisticated No-Code applications using the same.

The first question which obviously comes to mind is what do I need to get started on the Unified Development Platform powered by **HCL Volt MX**.

## **How to get started**

HCL Software provides a range of options for someone who wants to explore the concept of UDP thru **HCL Volt MX**.

**HCL Volt MX Trial** - The HCL Volt MX Free Trial Account will provide you with the following:

- **HCL Leap:** IDE for citizen developers to build apps in minutes

So what are you waiting for - [Click on this link to get access to the trial account today](https://manage.demo-hclvoltmx.com/registration)

## **HCL Leap Sandbox**

Once you signup for your trial account. You get access to to HCL Leap Sandbox at the following URL.

[**HCL Leap Sandbox - Trial Account**](https://leapsandbox.hclpnp.com/leap-mx/)

We have now optimised the trial process so the same credentials which was used to sign up for **HCL Volt MX Trial** can be used in HCL Leap. See the image below

## **Creating a Simple Single Form Application in HCL Leap**

Now that you have access to the HCL Leap Sandbox lets explore further.

You can now select **Create New App** and you shall be presented with 3 options as shown below:

![Create New App - HCL Leap](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQHkB6Kzf_9pWA/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1707800181289?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=ojhPA-33ecZnvtLi-pgC46qyEx_1A-FtUcbJhaHkpGQ){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

- **From Blank** - Creates a new blank Leap Application which can be designed according to your preference.
- **From Spreadsheet -** Creates a new Leap Application from a Spreadsheet and populates it with data from the Spreadsheet.
- **From Existing -** Will allow the user to import an existing HCL Leap application from another instance.

We are now creating a blank application to start with.

![Blank Application](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQFhZUezptzRWQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707800535867?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=-Uq8jRELqR13vTc--KI_XMJI_Nc7Znv4S7QnKvieLHs){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

Once selected - Blank Application define the other details about the application as shown below

![Defining the Application Name](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQE_mQgrkYB59w/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707800622412?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=Va8D7vK50W3Gr-AttFuL_weGXwFGVPKUnjw69AGiGVE){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

This will create a blank HCL Leap Application we shall explore this in the future posts.

![HCL Leap - Blank Application](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQEFVa_FQMmFug/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1707800770740?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=T-vofd1r1_w0y_SIbuk6Rd_psSJzY2aFZn1plRWPaes){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

We can also select **From Spreadsheet** which will allow creation of a HCL Leap Application from a spreadsheet. Even if the spreadsheet has multiple tabs HCL Leap will convert it into Forms and also import the data present. Let's see below:

![From Spreadsheet](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQE4x-Rf9uOzZQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707800948158?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=_TG-olXL_GmOAZflYhM8Qqn8JDKDSfAvZRdwqYAw6sM){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

Choose your spreadsheet to be imported. You can select other options based on the data or how your spreadsheet is organised.

![Spreadsheet - Import](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQGVfFm1AR3x2Q/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707801070230?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=Ow1LlCxpVCGgxOw-iNUJD5n-v0Vku55xaJ-i6ks2FNY){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

Now HCL Leap will import and show you the fields and their datatypes which can be adjusted you can do this later too..

![Field selection and Sheet selection](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQHvsk4A7DiOCg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707801260151?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=EYrgxgPs6fdlLcwelH4eCeQWpn5zWRfbx7G4BV2a5uc){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

Once done you will need to define the application name as you had done in the previous blank application case.

![Application Name - Spreadsheet Import](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQFOjJWeH6yASw/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707801344190?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=_h_cV3ISDMTHS0JK1aR8NINmKD4JG-UrIHiZlxoeQOk){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

Once you hit create HCL Leap will import the spreadsheet and its data and create a readymade application for you.

![HCL Leap Application is now live](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQExPZ9_f5BTUQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1707801417961?e=1713398400&v=beta&t=UPe5sc_R1iBYmfV9G5r2BdGO4iEknLe6KGEH6Ys6HPA){: style="height:65%;width:85%"}

You can **Launch the application** or **Edit** the Application. On Launching you shall get the form which can populated.

In the next post we shall see how we can view the data and also some of the other aspects of HCL Leap.
