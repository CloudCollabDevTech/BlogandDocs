# **UDP (Low-Code No-Code) - Powered by HCL Volt MX - Primer Series 5/N**

## **Introduction to HCL Leap - No Code**

As explained in the [previous article](https://blog.cloudcollabdevtech.com/blog/2024/02/15/udp-low-code-no-code---powered-by-hcl-volt-mx---primer-series-4--n.html) - we got started on HCL Leap and we discovered how we can access Leap and start creating applications on the same.

In this article we will understand how to use **HCL Leap** in further detail especially the form part. **HCL Leap** is very advanced platform which will allow you develop very sophisticated No-Code applications.

Let's delve a little more deeper on **HCL Leap** which is part of the Unified Development Platform powered by **HCL Volt MX**.

## **Forms - Basic Building Blocks**

Lets create a blank application to access the Leap Designer.

### **Phase 1 - Blank Application**

Create a Blank Application as show below.

### **Phase 4 - Form Controls**

We can now design a form using various controls. You can use **Section** to organize you items better. **HCL Leap** will automatically create the backend database needed to store values from this form. A sample form is presented below.

You can observe the various sections and layout controls.

### **Phase 5 - Data Model**

You can see the data model for this form is already populated and data is stored in the same. No need to design the database and the object model **HCL Leap** can do that for you.

### **Phase 6 - Field Properties**

You can see that any field you add will have properties to adjust the appearance and other aspects. You will Formula and also Events.

### **Phase 7 - Formula**

You can see formula associated which can automatically compute values like adding _"Sub Total"_ and _"Shipping"_ to get **"Total Cost"**

### **Phase 8 - Events**

You can also configure events which will allow you call a service like **'_onShow_'** event you can a service which populates all the Regions from another Form.

### **Phase 9 - Dashboard or Landing Page**

You can build a Dashboard or a Landing Page for your Application. This page can have links and also a datagrid to show data values which can function like a View. You can create Action or Links to allow users to create new entries.

### **Phase 10 - Deploy / Launch Application**

The final application will be now ready to be deployed and you can manage other aspects of the same.

This is the fifth article on this topic. Next Article we shall explore how to build services for lookup and other aspects of building a citizen developer application using **HCL Leap**. Look out for another one next week. Till then happy reading and reach out to me if you would want more information..
