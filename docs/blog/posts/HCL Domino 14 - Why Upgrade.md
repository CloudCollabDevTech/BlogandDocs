# **HCL Domino 14 - Why Upgrade**

Post 1/2

## **Introduction**

When HCL Software took over the reins of HCL Domino from IBM. We at HCL Software worked on a belief and thought process which is reflective of our mantra #dominoforever. This is not an empty statement or some marketing statement it truly defines us, and we have been able to demonstrate this amply in the last 4 years. We have launched at least 4 major releases of HCL Domino (10, 11, 12 and now 14) in the last 4 years. All these releases have focused on numerous enhancements, new features, technical debt in addition to productivity and holistically improving all around experience be it User / Administrator / Developer.

## **HCL Domino 14 “Thames” – Key Points**

We had already announced plans to launch Domino 14 as soon as Version 12 was launched. As a part of our continuous delivery and feedback mechanism we launched Domino Jams to collect feedback from various user groups to shape the direction and understand the key themes for HCL Domino 14 “Thames”. We followed that up with an Early Access Program (EAP) to deliver upcoming capabilities and collect early feedback and do the necessary course corrections. As a result of all this we have focused on 3 major themes in this release:

- **Empower your users –** Focus on end user features and new productivity enhancements.
- **Modernize your toolset –** Updating the backend components to make them “future-proof” plus enhancing security and simplifying future updates.
- **Simply Administration –** Multi Device System Administration on the go. Auto Update to keep system current and secure plus risk free

Since HCL Domino Version 10 keeping our commitment to continued investment and evolving Domino Capability we have delivered over **“820” New Features.**
